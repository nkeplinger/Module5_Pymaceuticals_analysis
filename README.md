Three observations made in this Analysis include the following:
1. The observed timepoints across each treatment were not equal
2. Treatments Capomulin and Ramicane had the lowest mean tumor volume of all the treatments 
3. Treatments Capomulin and Ramicane had the most mice evaluated AND the most timepoints evalauted across all treatments"""

Note: Did not finish plotting the coorlation on the last graph
Also, the Tasking is often listed in a separate cell than the solution so that I could continue to compare questions/excpected outcomes and solutions
